## Developer friendly NLP ‚ú®
[<img align="right" src="https://decisively.github.io/wink-logos/logo-title.png" width="100px" >](https://winkjs.org/)

winkNLP is a JavaScript library for Natural Language Processing (NLP). Designed specifically to make development of NLP solutions **easier** and **faster**, winkNLP is optimized for the right balance of performance and accuracy.  The package can handle large amount of raw text at speeds over **525,000 tokens/second**. And with a test coverage of ~100%, winkNLP is a tool for building production grade systems with confidence.

## Features
It packs a rich feature set into a small foot print codebase of [under 1500 lines](https://coveralls.io/github/winkjs/wink-nlp?branch=master):

1. Fast, lossless & multilingual [tokenizer](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/processing-pipeline.html)

2. Developer friendly and intuitive [API](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/getting-started.html)

3. Built-in [API](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/visualizing-markup.html) to aid [text visualization](https://observablehq.com/@winkjs/how-to-perform-sentiment-analysis?collection=@winkjs/winknlp-recipes)

4. Easy information extraction from raw text

5. Extensive [text processing features](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/its-as-helper.html) such as bag-of-words, frequency table, stop word removal, readability statistics computation and many more.

6. Pre-trained [language models](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/language-models.html) with sizes starting from <3MB onwards

7. [BM25-based vectorizer](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/bm25-vectorizer.html)

8. Multiple [similarity](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/similarity.html) methods

9. Word vector integration

10. Comprehensive [NLP pipeline](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/processing-pipeline.html) covering tokenization, sentence boundary detection, negation handling, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech (pos) tagging, lemmatization, named entity extraction, custom entities detection and pattern matching

11. No external dependencies

12. [Runs on web browsers](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/wink-nlp-in-browsers.html).


## Installation

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wink-nlp) install:

```shell
npm install wink-nlp --save
```

In order to use winkNLP after its installation, you also need to install a language model. The following command installs the latest version of default language model ‚Äî the light weight English language model called [wink-eng-lite-model](https://github.com/winkjs/wink-eng-lite-model).

```shell
node -e "require( 'wink-nlp/models/install' )"
```
Any required model can be installed by specifying its name as the last parameter in the above command. For example:
```shell
node -e "require( 'wink-nlp/models/install' )" wink-eng-lite-model
```

### How to install for Web Browser
If you‚Äôre using winkNLP in the browser use the [wink-eng-lite-web-model](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wink-eng-lite-web-model) instead. Learn about its installation and usage in our [guide to using winkNLP in the browser](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/wink-nlp-in-browsers.html).

## Getting Started
The "Hello World!" in winkNLP is given below:

```javascript
// Load wink-nlp package  & helpers.
const winkNLP = require( 'wink-nlp' );
// Load "its" helper to extract item properties.
const its = require( 'wink-nlp/src/its.js' );
// Load "as" reducer helper to reduce a collection.
const as = require( 'wink-nlp/src/as.js' );
// Load english language model ‚Äî light version.
const model = require( 'wink-eng-lite-model' );
// Instantiate winkNLP.
const nlp = winkNLP( model );

// NLP Code.
const text = 'Hello   Worldüåé! How are you?';
const doc = nlp.readDoc( text );

console.log( doc.out() );
// -> Hello   Worldüåé! How are you?

console.log( doc.sentences().out() );
// -> [ 'Hello   Worldüåé!', 'How are you?' ]

console.log( doc.entities().out( its.detail ) );
// -> [ { value: 'üåé', type: 'EMOJI' } ]

console.log( doc.tokens().out() );
// -> [ 'Hello', 'World', 'üåé', '!', 'How', 'are', 'you', '?' ]

console.log( doc.tokens().out( its.type, as.freqTable ) );
// -> [ [ 'word', 5 ], [ 'punctuation', 2 ], [ 'emoji', 1 ] ]
```
Experiment with the above code on [RunKit](https://npm.runkit.com/wink-nlp).

## Processing Pipeline

Read more about the processing pipeline and how to configure it in the [winkNLP documentation](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/processing-pipeline.html).


## Speed & Accuracy
The [winkNLP](https://winkjs.org/wink-nlp/) processes raw text at **~525,000 tokens per second** with its default language model ‚Äî [wink-eng-lite-model](https://github.com/winkjs/wink-eng-lite-model), when [benchmarked](https://github.com/bestiejs/benchmark.js) using "Ch 13 of Ulysses by James Joyce" on a 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 machine with 16GB RAM. The processing included the entire NLP pipeline ‚Äî tokenization, sentence boundary detection, negation handling, sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity extraction. This speed is way ahead of the prevailing speed benchmarks.

The benchmark was conducted on [Node.js versions 14.8.0, and 12.18.3](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/).

It pos tags a subset of WSJ corpus with an accuracy of **~94.7%** ‚Äî this includes *tokenization of raw text prior to pos tagging*. The current state-of-the-art is at ~97% accuracy but at lower speeds and is generally computed using gold standard pre-tokenized corpus.

Its general purpose sentiment analysis delivers a [f-score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) of **~84.5%**, when validated using Amazon Product Review [Sentiment Labelled Sentences Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00331/) at [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php). The current benchmark accuracy for **specifically trained** models can range around 95%.

## Memory Requirement
Wink NLP delivers this performance with the minimal load on RAM. For example, it processes the entire [History of India Volume I](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/History_of_India/Volume_1) with a total peak memory requirement of under **80MB**. The book has around 350 pages which translates to over 125,000 tokens.
